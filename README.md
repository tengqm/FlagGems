## About

FlagGems is part of [FlagOS](https://flagos.io/), a unified, open-source AI system software stack that
aims to foster an open technology ecosystem by seamlessly integrating various models, systems and chips.
By "develop once, migrate across various chips", FlagOS aims to unlock the full computational potential
of hardware, break down the barriers between different chip software stacks, and effectively reduce
migration costs.

FlagGems is a high-performance, generic operator library implemented in [Triton](https://github.com/openai/triton) language.
It is built on a collection of backend-neutral kernels that aims to accelerate LLM (Large-Language Models) training
and inference across diverse hardware platforms.

By registering with the ATen backend of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), FlagGems facilitates a seamless transition,
allowing model developers to switch to Triton without changing the low level APIs.
Users can continue using their familiar Pytorch APIs while at the same time benefit from new hardware acceleration technologies.
For kernel developers, the Triton language offers readability, user-friendliness and performance comparable to CUDA.
This convenience allows developers to engage in the development of FlagGems with minimal learning investment.

## Features

FlagGems provides the following technical features.

- A large collection of PyTorch compatible operators
- Hand-optimized performance for selective operators
- Eager-mode ready, independent of `torch.compile`
- Automatic pointwise operator codegen supporting arbitrary input types and layout
- Fast per-function runtime kernel dispatching
- Multi-backend interface enabling support of [diverse hardware platforms](./docs/features.md#generic-interface-for-diverse-platforms)
- Over 10 supported backends
- C++ Triton function dispatcher (working in progress)

Check the [features](./docs/features.md) documentation for more details.
